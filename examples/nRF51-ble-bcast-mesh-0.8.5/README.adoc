= nRF OpenMesh (formerly nRF51-ble-broadcast-mesh)

Bluetooth Low Energy based rebroadcasting mesh implementation on the nRF51 called *nRF OpenMesh*.
Works with SoftDevice S110 v8.x and S130 v1.0 with Timeslot API, and the nRF51 SDK8.1.
Offers an API for implementing your own mesh enabled application, operating
concurrently with regular BLE applications.

== Usage
In addition to two provided examples, there is a template project under
_nRF51/examples/_. This may be used as a basis for your own applications, or you
could choose to do it yourself from scratch. In theory, the framework should be
compatible with most SoftDevice based projects, but some restrictions to
hardware and software modules apply, see
link:docs/how_it_works.adoc#resource-allocation[Resource allocation]  for
details. The framework adds a Mesh GATT service to the SoftDevice GATT server
which contain all mesh-global states. This service may be accessed by external
nodes, just as any other GATT service, through a connection established via the
SoftDevice. See section link:docs/how_it_works.adoc#gatt-service[GATT service]
for details about structure and access.

=== Serial interface

The framework also has support for external control via SPI or UART. The serial
interface is based on the nRF8001 SPI interface, with different opcodes. An
application controller framework using SPI is available under
_application_controller_, with an Arduino example to get you started. Note
that the application controller requires the
https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-arduino[ble-sdk-arduino]
framework. This allows you to operate an Arduino along with an nRF51 dev kit
in the mesh, making it easier to create mesh applications. Each nRF51 example
project has a separate target (named "nRF51822 xxAA serial") that incorporates
the serial interface with the rest of the project.

=== Getting started

The framework requires nRF51 SDK 8.1, and can be built with both Keil uVision
and GCC-arm-none-eabi.

The example projects utilizes the *non-pack* version of the SDK, available
at http://developer.nordicsemi.com/[Nordic Semiconductor's developer portal].
Clone this repo into _<SDK8-folder>/examples/<Project-folder>_.

This will ensure that all references to the SDK are correctly placed, so that
you don't have to change all references to the SDK in the project files. If
you still want to clone the repo into a different folder than suggested, you
need to change the location of all the files under the _Lib_ group in Keil
uVision, in addition to the include paths under the menu
_Target options -> C/C++ -> Include Paths_ (or in the project-local
makefiles for GCC).

=== Integrating with existing applications
The framework is built to be compatible with most existing SDK example
projects, and as of v0.6.9, it is also compatible with the SDK module
APP_TIMER right out of the box.
In order to be compatible with the APP_TIMER module, the framework makes
use of the Quadrature Decoder hardware interrupt handler for asynchronous
processing.
Applications which already use this hardware module must be altered to
use a different interrupt for mesh processing. All async-behavior is
contained in the _event_handler.c_ file.

We've written a short guide to include it in existing projects with as
few changes to existing code as possible. The guide uses the ble_app_proximity
example from the SDK as reference, and shows a step by step approach to
overcoming typical problems with integration:

== Basic concepts

A rebroadcasting mesh network works by flooding all messages to all nodes
in the network through broadcasts. Each time a device receives a broadcast
message from some other device in the mesh, it repeats the message, or
_rebroadcasts_ it, letting its neighbors hear the new message.
The neighbors rebroadcast the message to their neighbors, and the process
is repeated until all devices in the mesh have received the message. This
lets wireless devices talk to each other without being within direct radio
range, as devices between them help relaying the messages.

The Rebroadcasting Mesh framework (hereby referred to as "the framework" or
rbc_mesh) provides a connection-less, rebroadcasting infrastructure for
synchronizing states across a set of BLE enabled nodes. All nodes receive all
messages that are transmitted within their range, and any node may update the
mesh-global states. There is no hierarchy, and no directed data links.

The framework resides on top of the nRF51 SoftDevice, utilizing the Timeslot
API to allocate radio time. The framework will attempt to allocate as much time
as possible, in order to listen for other nodes' messages.

All nodes in the mesh share a set of indexed data slots. The data contained at each
index is propagated through the mesh with version numbers, with the objective of
synchronizing the same version of the data across all nodes in the mesh. Each
time a node overwrites a value, it increments the version number, and all nodes
that receive a broadcast message with a version number that is higher than the
one in its database, will adapt this new version of the value.

The value propagation is controlled by an implementation of the IETF RFC6206
"Trickle", a flood control algorithm for lossy, low power networks. The Trickle
algorithm dynamically decides intervals at which a value will be broadcast by
a node, based on how many consistent messages the node picks up, and when the last
update to the state it manages was. The Trickle algorithm dynamically adapts to
node density and value update frequency.

The framework provides each handle-value pair with one Trickle-instance (an
isolated version of the algorithm), and utilizes a Least-recently-used cache-
system to store the values. When a value falls out of the "data cache", the device
stops retransmitting it, and when the value falls out of the larger "handle cache",
the device also forgets which version of the value it saw last.

The mesh can be interfaced by regular BLE devices through a GATT characteristic in the
Softdevice. The application is responsible for advertising and managing the external
connection, and the "BLE Gateway example" displays a way to achieve such behavior.

== About
The "nRF OpenMesh" was created in collaboration with The Norwegian University of
Science and Technology (NTNU), as part of a master's thesis pre-study. The project is not
part of the official Nordic Semiconductor SDK. Developers are welcome to contribute
and provide feedback.
