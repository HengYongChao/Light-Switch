= Full flash hex files

These hex files contains everything needed to test a single run of the bootloader. They are merged
hex files of Softdevice, Bootloader, device page and potentially an application.

The hex files are marked for whether they have an application in them (_app or _no_app), and
whether the bootloader has the timeout flag set or not (_to or _no_to).

The application has serial support, and will not be able to pick up an over-the-air transfer.

The dfu_test.zip file is a pregenerated DFU transfer flashing the same application, but with a
higher version number, and can be used to test whether the dfu runs to completion, and works as
intended. The transfer is not signed.
