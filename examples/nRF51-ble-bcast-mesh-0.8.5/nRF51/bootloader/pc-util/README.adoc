= Device page generator tool

This simple tool is intended for PC/Linux/Mac, and will generate a device page from a
specified input file. A device page is an in-flash storage area from which the bootloader can read
device information required for correct operation. Values like application start address, public
key for verifying dfu-transfers and firmware IDs allows the bootloader to make qualified decisions
about whether to accept incoming dfu-transfers, and where the data belongs.

== Build/run
The GNU Makefile in this repository can be used to build the tool with GCC (tested on Linux with GCC
4.8.1, and on Windows with MinGW + GCC4.8.1). The application
only consists of a single file, and should be platform-independent. A pre-built version of the
tool for Windows can also be found in this directory.

*NOTE:* The tool depends on the objcopy executable distributed with the GCC toolchain or MinGW.
Objcopy must present be either in the same directory as the generator tool, or in your PATH env.

== Input file

The input file is a text file consisting of a set of handle-value pairs.
The handle-value pair assignment must follow this format:
<handle>: <value>
There can only be one handle per line. Lines starting with # are comments.

The example file in this directory contains all allowed handles, and their values.

Below is a list of all allowed handles, their format, whether they are mandatory for proper
operation and a short description.

.All handles allowed
|===
|Handle name    | Data type | Required  | Description
|SD_START       | uint32_t  | Yes       | Start of permitted Softdevice area. Should be right after the MBR (see the Softdevice Specification for your favorite Softdevice)
|SD_SIZE        | uint32_t  | Yes       | Size of permitted Softdevice area.
|APP_START      | uint32_t  | Yes       | Start of permitted application area. Should be immediately after the Softdevice.
|APP_SIZE       | uint32_t  | Yes       | Size of permitted application area.
|BL_START       | uint32_t  | Yes       | Start of permitted bootloader area. Should be towards the end of the available flash-memory.
|BL_SIZE        | uint32_t  | Yes       | Size of permitted bootloader area.
|COMPANY_ID     | uint32_t  | Yes       | Company ID associated with the application on this device.
|APP_ID         | uint16_t  | Yes       | Application ID associated with the application on this device.
|APP_VERSION    | uint32_t  | Yes       | Currently flashed version of the application.
|SD_VERSION     | uint16_t  | Yes       | Required Softdevice for the application on this device, or 0xFFFE if it doesn't matter.
|BL_ID          | uint8_t   | Yes       | ID of the bootloader on this device.
|BL_VERSION     | uint8_t   | Yes       | Version of the bootloader on this device.
|Verification key Qx | uint8_t[32] | No | First part of the public signing key used to verify incoming DFU transfers.
|Verification key Qy | uint8_t[32] | No | Second part of the public signing key used to verify incoming DFU transfers.
|PUBLIC_KEY     | uint8_t[64] | No      | Alternative full-version of the public signing key used to verify incoming DFU transfers.
